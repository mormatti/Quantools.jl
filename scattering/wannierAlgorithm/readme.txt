Assumptions

- The system is 1-dimensional with local dimension d;
- For PBC of the system, it is defined a translation operator T (lattice geometry).
- The Hamiltonian of the system is translational invariant, i.e. [H,T] = 0;
- The system is gapped (or, at least the gap is ϵ>0);

From these, some inputs:
- The local dimension of the system d (of both ℋ and ℋ′);
- The number of sites L of the small PBC system ℋ′;
- The basis of the groundstate sector of ℋ′;
- The basis of the particle sector of ℋ′;
- The local Hamiltonian Hⱼ in matrix form (p-local operator like);
- The translation operator T for the two sectors;
- The translation operator 


We put the following limit:
- For dim(ℋ′) < 20000 we use exact diagonalization;
- For higher values we use the Arnoldi method.
